Most of your grade is dependent on quizzes and weekly programming assignments. Course is curved so if you take good notes during lecture and finish the assignments, you will most likely pass. ",0,0
0,5,2022-05-09 09:12:46,4,CECS451,True,False,True,A,"This was not an easy course, but Moon makes it doable. Assignments were coded in python and handwritten and relates to the lecture. Moon at times extended assignments. Especially the latter half of the course is stats heavy, so please pay attention. This class is very time consuming. Dr. Moon is one of the best professors, please take him.",0,0

Lectures are well organized and he doesn't pull anything unfair on his quizzes. HW is done in Python and he's very generous with extensions. Second half is heavily stats based so review your EE381. One of the best professors here, take him if you can.",0,0

Posts all lectures online. Labs consist of weekly Python projects that relate to his lectures. Exams are hard, but he curves at the end of the semester. 451 is hard but you get what you put in his class. Recommend!",0,0
0,5,2020-05-14 05:17:31,4,CECS551,True,False,True,B+,Knows material really well. Helpful at all times. There are assignments due almost every week. Tests are pretty challenging. Group Projects are helpful to learn material. Overall great professor. One of the best professors in the CECS department for Computer Science,0,0
0,4,2019-08-27 04:01:30,4,CECS451,True,False,True,B,"Tough but forgiving professor. Decent at explaining concepts (although it did get confusing at times, but then again it was an AI class so you know...). Expect to put in a lot of work in this class. Pick your programming groups wisely! He also read some of these reviews on the 1st day so if you're reading this in class then I just wanna say Hi!",0,0
0,4,2019-06-02 21:13:33,4,CECS424,True,,True,B,"He is a caring professor and the homework load was not too time consuming. Lab assignments are due every week. He actually writes notes when lecturing which is nice. The labs used Java, C + +, JavaScript, Python, and Haskell. He focuses too much of his tests on Haskell. Some labs are textbook problems. He is a nice guy.",1,0
0,5,2018-12-20 06:38:33,3,CECS524,True,False,True,,Diligent towards making you learn. Also provides obligatory interview tips and questions. Really cool professor and he care for his students.,10,0

0,3,2018-04-11 13:38:00,3,CECS327,True,False,True,,"He is a fine teacher, just show up and pay attention and you should be fine. Make sure to ask for help if you need it during Lab assignments. He is honestly a very basic teacher. Literally just do normal good student things and you will pass. PowerPoint lectures are basically the exams. He posts everything on beachboard which is nice.",0,0
0,3,2018-01-13 14:42:36,4,CECS341,False,,True,B,"Average-hard tbh. Lectures based on powerpoints, but is capable of giving more detail. Midterms and final are average-hard in difficulty. Half of the questions exam is problems from lectures, HW, labs, other half are questions he makes up. Studying lectures alone will get you to a B. You have to do more to get an A. You do learn a lot, though.",0,0
